## June 21, 2019, 03:37 

- Among the developers we contacted, only 3 developers contacted us again, so we had to take another measures.
- We contacted to security team of cloud service provider(CSP) such as AWS, and asked them to help each app developer take an action.

- We had the first response from the security team of CSP.

## June 22, 2019, 10:56

## June 23 - 24, 2019 03:28

- We had the second response from the security team of CSP.
- They asked us the full list of vulnerable apps.

- As CSP's request, we sent them the entire list of vulnerable apps, which were classfied as actually risky by soFrida. 

## June 25, 2019
